## Background

ToDo: What does GBIF say?

## Is there another way?

Possibly.

For heavy-duty analysis of large datasets, you might need to use big data tools. But for some small tasks, you can get by with a handful of command-line tools.

## Building blocks

### Extracting a single column of data

ToDo: Intro

```{bash eval=FALSE}
#!/usr/bin/awk -f

BEGIN {
  FS="\t"
  matchcol=ARGV[1]
  ARGV[1]=""
}

FNR==1 {
  for (col=1;col<=NF;col++)
    if ($col==matchcol)
      next
}

{ print $col }

```

If the above script is saved as the executable file `get_col` it can be used to extract the column `license` from the `multimedia.txt` file as shown below.

```{bash}
./get_col license multimedia.txt > licenses.txt
```

### Extracting unique values from a column



## Examples

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
